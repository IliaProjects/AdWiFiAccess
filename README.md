# AdWiFiAccess

This project is a distributed system that provides internet access through Wi-Fi hotspots on MikroTik devices after the user performs one of the following actions: watching an advertisement video or liking and sharing an advertising post on Facebook. MikroTik devices are installed in public places such as cafes, public transport, hotels, and others. The project is implemented using .NET MVC for the server side and RouterOS scripts for MikroTik devices. After connecting to the access point, the router offers the user a choice between watching an advertisement video or navigating to a Facebook post. Upon completing the selected action, the user receives limited-time access to the open network. The server side consists of two projects and one database: the main project manages user access to the internet, while the auxiliary project keeps track of views, network users, router online status, and other information.
